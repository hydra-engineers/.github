# Welcome to the Cheap Shoppers project!
We are a dedicated team of software engineers and developers. We are currently working on public REST API for collecting information about supermarkets located within the netherlands.

## Getting Started
We also have a couple of public repositories of which your able to help us improve it. In order to start development of any project you'll need to apply certain standards. We tried to make it as easy as possible for you to apply these standards. So we made a couple of guids on our wiki for you to follow. We got a list of prerequisites that are used by all of our engineers there aswell.
